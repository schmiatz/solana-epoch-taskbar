# Solana Epoch Tracker

A standalone macOS menu bar application that shows the current Solana epoch information. Track the current epoch, progress, and network status directly from your menu bar.

## Features

- Shows current epoch number and progress in the menu bar
- Displays remaining time until next epoch
- Supports Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet networks
- Shows network status (Progressing/Halted)
- Updates automatically every minute
- Native macOS menu bar integration

> **Note:** This application queries the public Solana RPC endpoints once a minute to fetch epoch information. If you're already using these endpoints for other purposes, you might encounter rate limits. For more information about rate limits and available endpoints, please refer to the [Solana Clusters documentation](https://solana.com/docs/references/clusters).
